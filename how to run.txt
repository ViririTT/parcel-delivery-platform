To run PATISA Transit locally, you'll need to set up a few things. Let me guide you through the process:

Prerequisites You'll Need:
Node.js 18+ installed on your machine
PostgreSQL database (local or cloud)
API credentials for external services
Quick Local Setup Steps:
1. Download Project Files
First, download all the project files from this environment to a folder on your local machine called patisa-transit.

2. Install Dependencies
Open terminal in the project folder and run:

npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in your actual values:

# Database - You'll need a PostgreSQL instance
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/patisa_transit
# Session security - Generate a random string
SESSION_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-key
# For payments - Get from Stripe dashboard
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_key
# For SMS - Get from Twilio console
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
4. Database Setup
Run this to create the database tables:

npm run db:push
5. Start Development Server
npm run dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

What You Need to Get:
For the database: You can either install PostgreSQL locally or use a free cloud service like:

Neon.tech (recommended for quick setup)
Supabase
Railway
For payments: Create a free Stripe account at stripe.com and get your test API keys

For SMS notifications: Create a free Twilio account and get your credentials

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this setup? For example, I can guide you through getting the Stripe or Twilio credentials, or help you set up a cloud database.
